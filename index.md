(i) I am assistant professor of the department of statistics at [London School of Economics and Political Science](http://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics) (LSE). 

(ii) Prior to (i), I was a Ph.D. student in [Statistics at North Carolina State University](https://www.stat.ncsu.edu/) (NCSU). I work with [Dr. Wenbin Lu](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~lu/) and 
[Dr. Rui Song](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~song/). 

(iii) Prior to (ii), I obtained a B.S. in Statistics from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in July 2014.

My research is concentrated on

<!---* [statistical methods in precision medicine](research_pm)-->
* statistical methods in reinforcement learning
* statistical analysis of complex data

The motivation behind my work stems from real world applications. In precision medicine, individualizing
the treatment decision rule can capture patients' heterogeneous response towards treatment. In finance,
individualizing the investment decision rule can improve individual's financial well-being. In a ride-sharing
company, individualizing the order dispatching strategy can increase its revenue and customer satisfaction. With the fast development of new technology, modern datasets often consist of massive observations, 
high-dimensional covariates and are characterized by some degree of heterogeneity. In an era of big and complex data, I'm interested in developing computationally efficient algorithms
with statistical performance guarantees.
