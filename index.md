### About

(i) I am assistant professor of the department of statistics at [London School of Economics and Political Science](http://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics) (LSE). 

(ii) Prior to (i), I was a Ph.D. student in [Statistics at North Carolina State University](https://www.stat.ncsu.edu/) (NCSU). I work with [Dr. Wenbin Lu](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~lu/) and 
[Dr. Rui Song](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~song/). 

(iii) Prior to (ii), I obtained a B.S. in Statistics from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in July 2014.

(iv) Prior to (iii), I graduated from [Ningbo Xiaoshi High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaoshi_Middle_School) in July 2010.

My email address is: <c.shi7@lse.ac.uk>. My [GitHub](https://github.com/callmespring). 

### Research Interests

My research is concentrated on

<!---* [statistical methods in precision medicine](research_pm)-->
* statistical methods in **reinforcement learning** (RL)
* statistical analysis of **complex** data, including
  * DAG-structured data 
  * multi-relational data
  * massive data
  * high-dimensional data 

The motivation behind my work stems from real world applications. In medicine, applying RL algorithms could assist patients in improving their health status. In robotics, applying RL algorithms enables robots to learn complex behaviors in dynamically changing environments. In ride-sharing platforms, applying RL algorithms could increase its revenue and customer satisfaction. With the fast development of new technology, modern datasets often consist of massive observations, 
high-dimensional covariates and are characterized by some degree of heterogeneity. In an era of big and complex data, I'm interested in developing computationally efficient algorithms with statistical performance guarantees.
