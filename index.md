### About

(i), I am an associate professor of the department of statistics at [London School of Economics and Political Science](http://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics) (LSE). 

(ii) Pior to (i), I was an assistant professor of the department of statistics at LSE. 

(iii) Prior to (ii), I was a Ph.D. student in [Statistics at North Carolina State University](https://www.stat.ncsu.edu/) (NCSU). I work with [Dr. Wenbin Lu](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~lu/) and 
[Dr. Rui Song](https://song-ray.github.io/). 

(iv) Prior to (iii), I obtained a B.S. in Statistics from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in July 2014.

(v) Prior to (iv), I graduated from [Ningbo Xiaoshi High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaoshi_Middle_School) in July 2010.

<!---I have a postdoc position funded by [EPSRC](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/W014971/1&utm_source=BenchmarkEmail&utm_campaign=PhD_Newsletter_-_LT_Week_05_(2021%2f22)&utm_medium=email). See the post [here](https://jobs.lse.ac.uk/Vacancies/W/3537/0/335760/15539/research-officer-in-statistics).-->

I was honoured to receive the [Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS) Tweedie Award](https://imstat.org/2024/03/05/chengchun-shi-receives-2024-ims-tweedie-new-researcher-award/) and the [Royal Statistical Society (RSS) Research Prize](https://rss.org.uk/news-publication/news-publications/2021/general-news/announcing-our-honours-recipients-for-2021/). 

I am looking for PhD students interested in reinforcement learning (see my lecture [slides](https://github.com/callmespring/RL-short-course) on RL, my [slides](https://github.com/callmespring/RL-short-course/blob/main/Lecture%205/OPEslides.pdf) on off-policy evaluation and our review [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06355.pdf)). 

My email <c.shi7@lse.ac.uk>. My [GitHub](https://github.com/callmespring). 

### Research

My research is motivated from the applications in precision medicine (a simulated [STARD](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ITRSelect/index.html) data example), mobile health (some simulated environments for [Diabetes](https://github.com/RunzheStat/TestMDP) and [Intern Health](https://github.com/limengbinggz/cusum-rl)), ridesharing (simulated environments for [Order Dispatch](https://github.com/callmespring/MDPOD) and [Spatio-temporal Policy Evaluation](https://github.com/RunzheStat/CausalMARL); see also my [talk](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1yo4y1j7FU/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=0ff25cf8645aa63231bec2428b94bf6f)), neuroscience and video-sharing platforms (see our KDD [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3580305.3599809) for details about our proposal successfully deployed in a widely used mobile app with millions of daily active users).
